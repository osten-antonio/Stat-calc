Topic
• Analysis of Variance

What Is a Two-Way ANOVA?
• A two-way analysis of variance is used to determine whether there is
a statistically significant difference between the means of three or
more independent groups that have been split on two variables (or
factors).
• The two-way ANOVA can be applied in different fields, such as
economics, finance, social science, and medicine.

When to Use a Two-Way ANOVA
• Use a two-way ANOVA when you’d like to know how two factors
affect a response variable and whether or not there is an interaction
effect between the two factors on the response variable

Example
• A botanist wants to explore how sunlight exposure and watering
frequency affect plant growth.
• She plants 40 seeds and lets them grow for 2 months under different
conditions for sunlight exposure and watering frequency.
• After 2 months, she records the height of each plant.
• In this case, we have the following variables:
oResponse variable: plant growth
oFactors: sunlight exposure, watering frequency

Example
• And we would like to answer the following questions:
o Does sunlight exposure affect plant growth?
o Does watering frequency affect plant growth?
o Is there an interaction effect between sunlight exposure and watering
frequency? (e.g., the effect that sunlight exposure has on the plants is
dependent on watering frequency)

• We would use a two-way ANOVA for this analysis because we have two
factors.
• If instead we wanted to know how only watering frequency affected
plant growth, we would use a one-way ANOVA since we would only be
working with one factor.

Two-Way ANOVA Assumptions
• The two-way ANOVA test has got two independent variables hence the
term two-way.
• That there as several assumptions that relate to the two-way analysis of
variance, as follows:
oThe sample population must be approximately normally or normally
distributed
oIt is mandatory for the samples to be independent
oIt is mandatory that the populations variances be equal
oThe sample size of the groups must be the same

A Two-Way ANOVA Hypotheses
• The two-way ANOVA has several sets to hypotheses.
• The null hypotheses are as follows:
oThe first factors population means are equal. It is the same as the
one-way ANOVA when it comes to the row factor
oThe second factors population means are equal. It is the same as
the one-way ANOVA when it comes to column factor
oBetween the two factors, no interaction exists. It is the same as
administering a test for independence using contingency tables.

Example
• The results are shown
(in inches):
• In the table, we see
that there were five
plants grown under
each combination of
conditions.

Example
• For example, there were
five plants grown with
daily watering and no
sunlight and their heights
after two months were
4.8 inches, 4.4 inches, 3.2
inches, 3.9 inches, and
4.4 inches:

Example: Step by Step
• Step 1: Calculate Sum of Squares for First Factor (Watering Frequency)
• First, calculate the grand mean height of all 40 plants:
Grand mean = (4.8 + 5 + 6.4 + 6.3 + … + 3.9 + 4.8 + 5.5 + 5.5) / 40 = 5.1525
• Next, we will calculate the mean height of all plants watered daily:
Mean of Daily = (4.8 + 5 + 6.4 + 6.3 + … + 4.4 + 4.8 + 5.8 + 5.8) /20 = 5.155
• Next, we will calculate the mean height of all plants watered weekly:
Mean of Weekly = (4.4 + 4.9 + 5.8 + 6 + … + 3.9 + 4.8 + 5.5 + 5.5) /20 = 5.15

Example: Step by Step
• Next, we will calculate the sum of squares for the factor “watering
frequency” by using the following formula:
Σn(Xj – X..)2
• where:
n: the sample size of group j
Σ: a greek symbol that means “sum”
Xj: the mean of group j
X..: the grand mean

• Calculate the sum of squares for the factor “watering frequency”:
20*(5.155-5.1525)2 + 20*(5.15-5.1525)2 = 0.00025

Example: Step by Step
• Step 2: Calculate Sum of Squares for Second Factor (Sunlight Exposure)
• First, we will calculate the grand mean height of all 40 plants:
Grand mean = (4.8 + 5 + 6.4 + 6.3 + … + 3.9 + 4.8 + 5.5 + 5.5) / 40 = 5.1525
• Next, we will calculate the mean height of all plants with no sunlight
exposure:
Mean of No Sunlight = (4.8+4.4+3.2+3.9+4.4+4.4+4.2+3.8+3.7+3.9) / 10 = 4.07
Mean of Low Sunlight = 5.1
Mean of Medium Sunlight = 5.89
Mean of High Sunlight = 5.55

Example: Step by Step
• Next, we will calculate the sum of squares for the factor “sunlight
exposure”.
• Calculate the sum of squares for the factor “sunlight exposure”:
10*(4.07-5.1525)2 + 10*(5.1-5.1525)2 + 10*(5.89-5.1525)2
+ 10*(5.55-5.1525)2 = 18.76475

Example: Step by Step
• Step 3: Calculate Sum of Squares Within (Error)
• Next, calculate the sum of squares within by taking the sum of squared
differences between each combination of factors and the individual
plant heights.
• For example, the mean height of all plants watered daily with no
sunlight exposure is 4.14.
• We can then calculate the sum of squared differences for each of these
individual plants as:
SS for daily watering and no sunlight: (4.8-4.14)2 + (4.4-4.14)2 + (3.24.14)2 + (3.9-4.14)2 + (4.4-4.14)2 = 1.512

Example: Step by Step
• Repeat this process for each combination of factors:
SS for daily watering and low sunlight: 0.928
SS for daily watering and medium sunlight: 1.788
SS for daily watering and high sunlight: 1.648
SS for weekly watering and no sunlight: 0.34
SS for weekly watering and low sunlight: 0.548
SS for weekly watering and medium sunlight: 0.652
SS for weekly watering and high sunlight: 1.268

• Sums of squares within = 1.512 + .928 + 1.788 + 1.648 + .34 + .548 +
.652 + 1.268 = 8.684

Example: Step by Step
• Step 4: Calculate Total Sum of Squares
• Next, calculate the total sum of squares by taking the sum of the
differences between each individual plant height and the grand mean:
Total Sum of Squares
= (4.8 – 5.1525)2 + (5 – 5.1525)2 + … + (5.5 – 5.1525)2
= 28.45975

Example: Step by Step
• Step 5: Calculate Sum of Squares Interaction
• Next, calculate the sum of squares interaction by using the following
formula:
SS Interaction = SS Total – SS Factor 1 – SS Factor 2 – SS Within
SS Interaction = 28.45975 – .00025 – 18.76475 – 8.684
SS Interaction = 1.01075

Example: Step by Step
• Step 6: Fill in ANOVA Table
df Watering Frequency: j-1 = 2-1 = 1
df Sunlight Exposure: k-1 = 4-1 = 3
df Interaction: (j-1)*(k-1) = 1*3 = 3
df Within: n – (j*k) = 40 – (2*4) = 32
df total: n-1 = 40-1 = 39
MS: SS/ df
F Watering Frequency: MS Watering Frequency / MS Within
F Sunlight Exposure: MS Sunlight Exposure / MS Within

Example: Step by Step
F Interaction: MS Interaction / MS Within
p-value Watering Frequency: The p-value that corresponds to F value
of .000921 with df numerator = 1 and df denominator = 32
p-value Sunlight Exposure: The p-value that corresponds to F value of
23.04898 with df numerator = 3 and df denominator = 32
p-value Interaction: The p-value that corresponds to F value of
1.241517 with df numerator = 3 and df denominator = 32
• Note #1: n = total observations, j = number of levels for watering
frequency, k = number of levels for sunlight exposure.
• Note #2: The p-values that correspond to the F-value were calculated
using the F Distribution Calculator.

Example
• She performs a twoway ANOVA in Excel
and ends up with the
following output:

Example: Step by Step
• Step 7: Interpret the results
• Observe the following from the ANOVA table:
• The p-value for the interaction between watering frequency and
sunlight exposure was 0.311 → This is not statistically significant at
α = 0.05.
• The p-value for watering frequency was 0.975 → This is not
statistically significant at α = 0.05.
• The p-value for sunlight exposure was < 0.000 → This is statistically
significant at α = 0.05.

Example
• These results indicate that sunlight exposure is the only factor that has
a statistically significant effect on plant height.
• And because there is no interaction effect, the effect of sunlight
exposure is consistent across each level of watering frequency.
• That is, whether a plant is watered daily or weekly has no impact on
how sunlight exposure affects a plant.

A Two-Way vs. One-Way ANOVA
• Analysis of variance exists in two types: one-way and two-way which
is also known as unidirectional and bidirectional, respectively.
• The two analyses of variance refer to independent variables number
in the analysis of variance test.
• One-Way ANOVA

o It’s a type of analysis of variance used to evaluate the sole factors impact on a
single response variable.
o It also tests the samples to find out if they are equal.
o In addition, it can be used to determine whether, between the means of three
or more unrelated groups, there are significant differences in the statistics.

A Two-Way vs. One-Way ANOVA
• Two-Way ANOVA
o There are two independent variables in this type of analysis of variance.
o With the two-way variables test, a company can easily compare the
productivity of its workers, based on two independent variables such as skills
and salary.
o It can utilize the test to observe how those two factors interact with each
other.
o It also tests the two factors effect simultaneously.
