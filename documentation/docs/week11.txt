Analysis of Variance

Introduction
• Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to test
differences between two or more means.
• It may seem odd that the technique is called “Analysis of Variance”
rather than “Analysis of Means.”
• As you will see, the name is appropriate because inferences about
means are made by analyzing variance.

When Can ANOVA Be Used?
• ANOVA can be used when the dependent variable in an experiment
or a quasi-experiment is measured on an interval scale or a ratio
scale.
• Analysis of variance would not be the right technique when the
dependent variable is measured on an ordinal scale or a categorical
scale.
• The interval scale of measurement is a type of measurement scale
that is characterized by equal intervals between scale units. Example:
the Fahrenheit scale to measure temperature.

When Can ANOVA Be Used?
• The ratio scale of measurement is a type of measurement scale. It’s
characterized by equal intervals between scale units and a minimum
scale value of zero.
• The ordinal scale is a type of measurement scale. Each value on the
ordinal scale has a unique meaning, and it has an ordered relationship
to every other value on the scale. Example: the results of a horse
race, reported as "win", "place", and "show". We can’t tell whether it
was a close race or whether the winning horse won by a mile.
• Categorical. Categorical variables take on values that are names or
labels. The color of a ball (red, green, blue) or the breed of a dog
(collie, shepherd, terrier) would be examples of categorical variables.

How Does ANOVA Work?
• Analysis of variance refers to a set of techniques for interpreting
differences between groups (in true experiments or in quasiexperiments).
• These techniques have similarities and differences.

• Note: Quasi-experiments are studies that aim to evaluate interventions
but that do not use randomization

Source: https://stattrek.com/

ANOVA Techniques
• Specify a mathematical model to describe how the independent variable(s) and the
dependent variable are related.
• Write statistical hypotheses to be tested by experimental data.
• Specify a significance level for a hypothesis test.
• Compute sums of squares for each effect in the model.
• Find degrees of freedom for each effect in the model.
• Based on sums of squares and degrees of freedom, compute mean squares for each
effect in the model.
• Find the expected value of the mean squares for each effect in the model.
• Compute test statistics, based on observed mean squares and their expected values.
• Find a P value for each observed test statistic.
• Accept or reject the null hypothesis, based on the P value and the significance level.
• Assess the magnitude of the effect of the independent variable(s), based on sums of
squares.

One-Way Analysis of Variance

One-Way Analysis of Variance: Example
• A pharmaceutical company conducts an experiment to test the effect
of a new cholesterol medication. They selects 15 subjects randomly
from a larger population. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of
three treatment groups. Within each treatment group, subjects receive
a different dose of the new medication. In Group 1, subjects receive 0
mg/day; in Group 2, 50 mg/day; and in Group 3, 100 mg/day.
• The treatment levels represent all the levels of interest to the
experimenter, so this experiment used a fixed-effects model to select
treatment levels for study.
• After 30 days, doctors measure the cholesterol level of each subject.

Example
• The results for all 15 subjects appear
in the table:
• In conducting this experiment, the
experimenter had two research
questions:
• Does dosage level have a
significant effect on cholesterol
level?
• How strong is the effect of dosage
level on cholesterol level?
Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
• To answer these questions, the experimenter intends to use one-way
analysis of variance.
• But before you crunch the first number in one-way ANOVA, you must
be sure that one-way ANOVA is the correct technique.
• That means you need to ask two questions:
• Is the experimental design compatible with one-way ANOVA?
• Does the data set satisfy the critical assumptions required for oneway ANOVA?
• Let's address both of those questions.

Example
• Experimental Design
• One-way ANOVA is only appropriate with one experimental design
- a completely randomized design.
• That is exactly the design used in our cholesterol study, so we can
check the experimental design box.

Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
• Critical Assumptions, one-way ANOVA makes 3 critical assumptions:
• Independence. The dependent variable score for each experimental
unit is independent of the score for any other unit.
• Normality. In the population, dependent variable scores are
normally distributed within treatment groups.
• Equality of variance (homogeneity of variance or
homoscedasticity). In the population, the variance of dependent
variable scores in each treatment group is equal.
• Therefore, for the cholesterol study, we need to make sure our data set
is consistent with the critical assumptions.

Example
Independence of Scores
• The assumption of independence is the most important assumption.
• When that assumption is violated, the resulting statistical tests can
be misleading.

• The independence assumption is satisfied by the design of the study,
which features random selection of subjects and random assignment
to treatment groups.
• Randomization tends to distribute effects of extraneous variables
evenly across groups.

Example
Normal Distributions in Groups
• Violations of normality can be a problem when sample size is small,
as it is in this cholesterol study.
• Therefore, it is important to be on the lookout for any indication of
non-normality.
• There are many ways to check for normality.
• Given the small sample size, our best option for testing normality is to
look at the following descriptive statistics

Example
• Central tendency. The mean and the median are summary measures used to
describe central tendency. With a normal distribution, the mean = the median
• Skewness. Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a probability
distribution. If observations are equally distributed around the mean, the
skewness value is zero; otherwise, the skewness value is positive or negative.
Skewness between -1 and +1 is consistent with a normal distribution.
• Kurtosis. It’s a measure of whether observations cluster around the mean of
the distribution or in the tails of the distribution. The normal distribution has
a kurtosis value of zero. Kurtosis between -2 and +2 is consistent with a
normal distribution.

Positive Skewed and Negative Skewed

source: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/

Calculate the Skewness Coefficient
• Skewness can be calculated using various methods, whereas the most
commonly used method is Pearson’s coefficient.

source: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/

Pearson’s First Coefficient of Skewness
• To calculate skewness values, subtract the mode from the mean, and
then divide the difference by standard deviation.

• Pearson’s first coefficient of skewness is helping if the data present
high mode.
• But, if the data have low mode or various modes, Pearson’s first
coefficient is not preferred, and Pearson’s second coefficient may be
superior, as it does not rely on the mode.

Pearson’s Second Coefficient of Skewness
• To calculate skewness values, subtract the median from the mean,
multiply the difference by 3, and divide the product by the standard
deviation.

What Is Kurtosis?
• Positive kurtosis indicates heavier tails and a more peaked
distribution, while negative kurtosis suggests lighter tails and a flatter
distribution.
• Kurtosis helps in analyzing the characteristics and outliers of a
dataset.

Types of Excess Kurtosis

Types of Excess Kurtosis
1. Leptokurtic or heavy-tailed distribution (kurtosis more than normal
distribution, Kurtosis > 3)
2. Mesokurtic (kurtosis same as the normal distribution, Kurtosis = 3)
3. Platykurtic or short-tailed distribution (kurtosis less than normal
distribution, Kurtosis < 3)

The Formula for Kurtosis
• The sample excess kurtosis is calculated as follows:

• n denotes the number of observations in the sample, X̄ is the sample
mean, whereas s is the sample standard deviation.

The Formula for Kurtosis
• The population raw kurtosis is calculated as follows:

• n denotes the number of observations in the sample, μ is the
population mean.

The Formula for Kurtosis
• If you subtract 3 from the kurtosis, you get excess kurtosis, which
compares the dataset to a normal distribution.
• The population excess kurtosis is calculated as follows:
Kexcess = K - 3
• For a normal distribution Kexcess = 0.

Raw Kurtosis
Use raw kurtosis when:
• Absolute Tailedness Matters: You want to measure the overall degree
of tailedness in a distribution without comparing it to a normal
distribution.
• Mathematical/Technical Applications: Certain statistical models or
formulas might require the raw fourth moment rather than a
deviation from normality.
• Comparing Across Datasets: If you're comparing the kurtosis of
multiple datasets but not necessarily against the normal distribution
baseline.

Excess Kurtosis
Use excess kurtosis when:
• Comparison to Normality is Key: You want to assess how "different"
the data's shape is from a normal distribution.
• Practical Interpretation: It simplifies the interpretation:
o 𝐾excess = 0: Same tailedness as normal.
o 𝐾 excess > 0: Heavier tails (leptokurtic).
o 𝐾 excess < 0: Lighter tails (platykurtic).

• Risk Analysis: In fields like finance, where fat tails indicate the
potential for extreme events, excess kurtosis is often preferred.

When to Use Minus 3
• Use raw kurtosis if you're calculating the actual tailedness of a
dataset.
• Use excess kurtosis if you need to compare a dataset to the normal
distribution.

Example Kurtosis
• The new data points are 27, 13, 17, 57, 113, and 25.
• First, calculate the mean; add up the numbers and divide by 6 to get
42.
s2=∑(yi−yˉ)2
s4=∑(yi−yˉ)4
where:
• yi=ith variable of the sample
• yˉ=Mean of the sample
source: https://www.investopedia.com/

Example Kurtosis
• To get s2, use each variable, subtract the mean, and then square the
result.
• Add all of the results together:

Example Kurtosis
• To get s4, use each variable, subtract the mean, and raise the result to
the fourth power.
• Add all of the results together:

Example Kurtosis
• So, our sums are:
s2=7,246
s4=26,694,358
• Now, calculate m2 and m4, the second and fourth moments of the
kurtosis formula:

Example Kurtosis

• So, the kurtosis is:

Example
• The table shows the mean, median, skewness, and kurtosis:
• In all three groups, the difference
between the mean and median looks
small.
• Skewness and kurtosis measures are
consistent with a normal distribution.
• These are crude tests, but they provide
some confidence for the assumption
of normality in each group.

Example
Homogeneity of Variance
• When the normality of variance assumption is satisfied, you can use
Hartley's Fmax test to test for homogeneity of variance.
• Step 1. Compute the sample variance ( s2j ) for each group
• Where Xi,j is the score for observation i
in Group j , Xj is the mean of Group j,
and nj is the number of observations in
Group j.

Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
• Here is the variance (s2j) for each group in the cholesterol study

Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
Homogeneity of Variance
• Step 2. Compute an F ratio from the following formula:
FRATIO = s2MAX / s2MIN
FRATIO = 1170 / 450
FRATIO = 2.6
• where s2MAX is the largest group variance, and s2MIN is the smallest
group variance.

Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
Homogeneity of Variance
• Step 3. Compute degrees of freedom ( df ).
df = n - 1
df = 5 - 1
df = 4
• where n is the largest sample size in any group.

Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
Homogeneity of Variance
• Step 4. Based on the degrees of freedom ( 4 ) and the number of
groups ( 3 ), Find the critical F value from the Table of Critical F Values
for Hartley's Fmax Test. From the table, we see that the critical Fmax
value is 15.5.
• Note: The critical F values in the table are based on a significance
level of 0.05.

Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example

Example
Homogeneity of Variance
• Step 5. Compare the observed F ratio computed in Step 2 to the
critical F value recovered from the Fmax table in Step 4.
• If the F ratio is smaller than the Fmax table value, the variances are
homogeneous.
• Otherwise, the variances are heterogeneous.
• Here, the F ratio (2.6) is smaller than the Fmax value (15.5), so we
conclude that the variances are homogeneous.

Example - Analysis of Variance
• Having confirmed that the critical assumptions are tenable, we can proceed with a
one-way analysis of variance. That means taking the following steps:
1.

Specify a mathematical model to describe the causal factors that affect the dependent
variable.
2. Write statistical hypotheses to be tested by experimental data.
3. Specify a significance level for a hypothesis test.
4. Compute the grand mean and the mean scores for each group.
5. Compute sums of squares for each effect in the model.
6. Find the degrees of freedom associated with each effect in the model.
7. Based on sums of squares and degrees of freedom, compute mean squares for each effect in
the model.
8. Compute a test statistic, based on observed mean squares and their expected values.
9. Find the P value for the test statistic.
10. Accept or reject the null hypothesis, based on the P value and the significance level.
11. Assess the magnitude of the effect of the independent variable, based on sums of squares.

Example
1. Mathematical Model
• In this experiment, the dependent variable ( X ) is the cholesterol level
of a subject, and the independent variable ( β ) is the dosage level
administered to a subject.
• Here is the fixed-effects model for a completely randomized design:
X ij= μ + βj+ ε i(j)
• where X i j is the cholesterol level for subject i in treatment group j, μ is
the population mean, β j is the effect of the dosage level administered
to subjects in group j; and ε i ( j ) is the effect of all other extraneous
variables on subject i in treatment j.
Source: https://stattrek.com/

Example
2. Statistical Hypotheses
• For fixed-effects models, it is common practice to write statistical
hypotheses in terms of the treatment effect β j.
• Null hypothesis: the independent variable (dosage level) has no effect on
the dependent variable (cholesterol level) in any treatment group.
H0: β j = 0 for all j
• Alternative hypothesis: the independent variable has an effect on the
dependent variable in at least one treatment group.
H1: β j ≠ 0 for some j
• If the null hypothesis is true, mean scores in the k treatment groups should
be equal. If the null hypothesis is false, at least one pair of mean scores
should be unequal.

Example
3. Significance Level
• The significance level (also known as alpha or α) is the probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
• Experimenters often choose significance levels of 0.05 or 0.01.
• For this experiment, let's use a significance level of 0.05.

Example
4. Mean Scores
• Analysis of variance begins by computing a grand mean and group means
• Grand mean. The grand mean (X) is the mean of all observations,
computed as follows

X = ( 1 / 15 ) * ( 210 + 210 + ... + 270 + 240 )
X = 238

Example
• Group means. The mean of group j ( X j ) is the mean of all observations
in group j, computed as follows:
X 1 = 258
X 2 = 246
X 3 = 210

• In the equations above, n is the total sample size across all groups; and
n j is the sample size in Group j .

Example
5. Sums of Squares
• A sum of squares is the sum of squared deviations from a mean
score. One-way analysis of variance makes use of three sums of
squares:
a. Between-groups sum of squares
b. Within-groups sum of squares
c. Total sum of squares

Example
a. Between-groups sum of squares (SSB)
• SSB measures variation of group means around the grand mean.
• It can be computed from the following formula:

Example
b. Within-groups sum of squares (SSW)
• SSW measures variation of all scores around their respective group
means.
• It can be computed from the following formula:

SSW = (210 - 258)2 + ….. + (240 - 210)2 = 2304 + … + 900 = 9000

Example
c. Total sum of squares (SST)
• SST measures variation of all scores around the grand mean.
• It can be computed from the following formula:

Example
• It turns out that the total sum of squares is equal to the betweengroups sum of squares plus the within-groups sum of squares, as
shown below:
SST = SSB + SSW
15,240 = 6240 + 9000

Example
6. Degrees of Freedom
• The term degrees of freedom (df) refers to the number of
independent sample points used to compute a statistic minus the
number of parameters estimated from the sample points.
• To illustrate what is going on, let's find the degrees of freedom
associated with the various sum of squares computations:
a. Between-groups sum of squares
b. Within-groups sum of squares
c. Total sum of squares

Example
a. Between-groups sum of squares (SSB)
• The between-groups sum of squares formula appears below:

• The formula uses k independent sample points, the sample means Xj. And
it uses one parameter estimate, the grand mean X, which was estimated
from the sample points.
• So, the between-groups sum of squares has k-1 degrees of freedom (dfBG).
dfBG = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

Example
b. Within-groups sum of squares (SSW)
• The within-groups sum of squares formula appears below:

• The formula uses n independent sample points, the individual subject scores
Xi j. And it uses k parameter estimates, the group means Xj, which were
estimated from the sample points. So, the within-groups sum of squares has
n - k degrees of freedom (dfWG).
n = Σ ni = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
dfWG = n - k = 15 - 3 = 12

Example
c. Total sum of squares (SST)
• The total sum of squares formula appears below:

• The formula uses n independent sample points, the individual subject
scores Xi j. And it uses one parameter estimate, the grand mean X,
which was estimated from the sample points. So, the total sum of
squares has n - 1 degrees of freedom (dfTOT).
dfTOT = n - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14

Example
• The degrees of freedom for each sum of squares are summarized in
the table below:

Example
7. Mean Squares
• A mean square is an estimate of population variance.
• It is computed by dividing a sum of squares (SS) by its corresponding
degrees of freedom (df), as shown below:
MS = SS / df
• To conduct a one-way analysis of variance, we are interested in two
mean squares:
a. Between-groups sum of squares
b. Within-groups sum of squares

Example
a. Between-groups sum of squares (SSB)
• The between-groups mean square ( MSBG ) refers to variation due to
differences among experimental units within the same group plus
variation due to treatment effects. It can be computed as follows:
MSBG = SSB / df BG
MSBG = 6240 / 2 = 3120

Example
b. Within-groups sum of squares (SSW)
• The within-groups mean square ( MSWG ) refers to variation due to
differences among experimental units within the same group. It can
be computed as follows:
MSWG = SSW / df WG
MSWG = 9000 / 12 = 750

Example
8. Test Statistic
• Suppose we use the mean squares to define a test statistic F as
follows:
F(v1, v2) = MSBG / MSWG
F(2, 12) = 3120 / 750 = 4.16
• where MSBG is the between-groups mean square, MSWG is the withingroups mean square, v1 is the degrees of freedom for MSBG, and v2 is
the degrees of freedom for MSWG.

Example
• The F ratio is a convenient measure that we can use to test the null
hypothesis. Here's how:
• When the F ratio is close to one, MSBG is approximately equal to
MSWG. This indicates that the independent variable did not affect
the dependent variable, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
• When the F ratio is significantly greater than one, MSBG is bigger
than MSWG. This indicates that the independent variable did affect
the dependent variable, so we must reject the null hypothesis.
• What does it mean for the F ratio to be significantly greater than one?
To answer that question, we need to talk about the P-value.

Example
9. P-Value
• In an experiment, a P-value is the probability of obtaining a result
more extreme than the observed experimental outcome, assuming
the null hypothesis is true.
• With ANOVA, the F ratio is the observed experimental outcome that
we are interested in.
• So, the P-value would be the probability that an F statistic would be
more extreme (i.e., bigger) than the actual F ratio computed from
experimental data.

Example
• We can use Stat Trek's F Distribution Calculator to
find the probability that an F statistic will be
bigger than the actual F ratio observed in the
experiment.
• https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/fdistribution
• From the calculator, we see that the P ( F > 4.16 )
equals about 0.04.
• Therefore, the P-Value is 0.04.

Example
10. Hypothesis Test
• We specified a significance level 0.05 for this experiment.
• Here's the decision rule for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis:
• If the P-value > α, accept the null hypothesis.
• If the P-value ≤ α, reject the null hypothesis.
• Since the P-value (0.04) < α (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis that
drug dosage had no effect on cholesterol level.
• And we conclude that the mean cholesterol level in at least one
treatment group differed significantly from the mean cholesterol level
in another group.

Example
11. Magnitude of Effect
• The hypothesis test tells us whether the independent variable in our
experiment has a statistically significant effect on the dependent
variable, but it does not address the magnitude of the effect.
• Here's the issue:
• When the sample size is large, you may find that even small
differences in treatment means are statistically significant.
• When the sample size is small, you may find that even big
differences in treatment means are not statistically significant.

Example
• It is customary to supplement analysis of variance with an
appropriate measure of effect size.
• Eta squared (η2) is one such measure.
• Eta squared is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable
that is explained by a treatment effect.
• The eta squared formula for one-way analysis of variance is:
• η2 = SSB / SST
• where SSB is the between-groups sum of squares and SST is the total
sum of squares.

Example
• Given this formula, we can compute eta squared for this drug dosage
experiment, as shown below:
• η2 = SSB / SST = 6240 / 15240 = 0.41
• Thus, 41 percent of the variance in our dependent variable
(cholesterol level) can be explained by variation in our independent
variable (dosage level).
• It appears that the relationship between dosage level and cholesterol
level is significant not only in a statistical sense; it is significant in a
practical sense as well.

experiment, at a glance.

Chi Square

What Are Categorical Variables?
• Categorical variables belong to a subset of variables that can be
divided into discrete categories. Names or labels are the most
common categories.
• Known as qualitative variables.
• Categorical variables can be divided into two categories:
• Nominal Variable: A nominal variable's categories have no natural
ordering. Example: Gender, Blood groups
• Ordinal Variable: A variable that allows the categories to be sorted
is ordinal variables. Customer satisfaction (Excellent, Very Good,
Good, Average, Bad, and so on) is an example.

What Is a Chi-Square Test?
• The Chi-Square test is a statistical procedure for determining the
difference between observed and expected data.
• Can be used to determine whether it correlates to the categorical
variables in our data.
• Helps to find out whether a difference between two categorical
variables is due to chance or a relationship between them.

Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Chi-Square Test Definition
• A statistical test that is used to compare observed and expected
results.
• The goal of this test is to identify whether a disparity between actual
and predicted data is due to chance or to a link between the variables
under consideration.
• A chi-square test is required to test a hypothesis regarding the
distribution of a categorical variable.
• Categorical variables, which indicate categories such as animals or
countries, can be nominal or ordinal.
Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Formula for Chi-Square Test
• Where:
• c = Degrees of freedom
• O = Observed Value
• E = Expected Value
• The degrees of freedom in a statistical calculation represent the
number of variables that can vary in a calculation.
• The Observed values are those you gather yourselves.
• The expected values are the frequencies expected, based on the null
hypothesis.
Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Chi-Square Test
• Chi-Squared Tests are most commonly used in hypothesis testing.
• The Chi-Square test estimates the size of inconsistency between the
expected results and the actual results when the size of the sample
and the number of variables in the relationship is mentioned.
• These tests use degrees of freedom to determine if a particular null
hypothesis can be rejected based on the total number of
observations made in the experiments.
• Larger the sample size, more reliable is the result.

Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Chi-Square Test
• There are two main types of Chi-Square tests namely • Independence
• Goodness-of-Fit

Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Independence
• It’s a derivable (also known as inferential) statistical test which
examines whether the two sets of variables are likely to be related
with each other or not.
• This test is used when we have counts of values for two nominal or
categorical variables and is considered as non-parametric test.
• A relatively large sample size and independence of observations are
the required criteria for conducting this test.

Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Independence
Example:
• In a movie theatre, suppose we made a list of movie genres.
• Let us consider this as the first variable.
• The second variable is whether or not the people who came to watch
those genres of movies have bought snacks at the theatre.
• Here the null hypothesis is that the genre of the film and whether
people bought snacks or not are unrelatable.
• If this is true, the movie genres don’t impact snack sales.

Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Goodness-of-Fit
• In statistical hypothesis testing, the Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test
determines whether a variable is likely to come from a given
distribution or not.
• We must have a set of data values and the idea of the distribution of
this data.
• We can use this test when we have value counts for categorical
variables.
• This test demonstrates a way of deciding if the data values have a
“good enough” fit for our idea or if it is a representative sample data
of the entire population.
Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Goodness-of-Fit
Example:
• Suppose we have bags of balls with five different colors in each bag.
• The given condition is that the bag should contain an equal number
of balls of each color.
• The idea we would like to test here is that the proportions of the five
colors of balls in each bag must be exact.

Source: https://www.simplilearn.com/

Goodness-of-Fit
Example:
• A die is rolled 60 times. You want to test if the die is fair (i.e., each
side has an equal probability of appearing).

Null Hypothesis (H0​): The die is fair, so the observed frequencies match
the expected frequencies.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1​): The die is not fair, so the observed
frequencies do not match the expected frequencies.

Goodness-of-Fit
Example:

Conclusion Statement
• Depends on whether the calculated chi-square value is greater than
or less than the critical value.
• If greater than the critical value: reject the null hypothesis
• If less than the critical value: fail to reject the null hypothesis

Example
• We want to know if gender has anything to do with political party
preference. Poll 420 voters in a simple random sample to find out
which political party they prefer. The results of the survey are shown
in the table below:

• To see if gender is linked to political party preference, perform a ChiSquare test of independence using the steps below.

expected value for Male Republicans is:
420

114,29

• Similarly, you can calculate the expected value for each of the cells.

Example
• Step 3: Calculate (O - E)2 / E for Each Cell in the Table
• Where: O = Observed Value and E = Expected Value

Example
• Step 4: Calculate the Test Statistic X2
X2 is the sum of all the values in the last table
= 1.79 + 1.06 + 1.61 + 1.62 + 0.96 + 1.46
= 8.50

• Before conclude, first determine the critical statistic, which requires
determining our degrees of freedom (df).
• The degrees of freedom in this case are equal to the table's number
of columns minus one multiplied by the table's number of rows
minus one, or (c-1) (r-1) → (3-1)(2-1) = 2

Example
• Compare obtained statistic with the
chi-square table.
• For α = 0.05 and df =2, the critical
statistic is 5.991, less than our obtained
statistic of 8.50.
• You can reject our null hypothesis
because the obtained statistic is higher
than your critical statistic, means it has
sufficient evidence to say that there is
an association between gender and
political party preference.

What the Difference?
• Chi-Square test is used when we perform hypothesis testing on two
categorical variables from a single population or we can say that to
compare categorical variables from a single population.
• T-test is an inferential statistic that is used to determine the
difference or to compare the means of two groups of samples which
may be related to certain features. It is performed on continuous
variables.
• Analysis of variance is used to compare multiple (three or more)
samples with a single test. It is used when the categorical feature has
more than two categories.

Z-TEST
• In a z-test, we assume the sample is normally distributed.
• A z-score is calculated with population parameters such as population
mean and population standard deviation.
• We use this test to validate a hypothesis that states the sample
belongs to the same population.

T-TEST
• We use a t-test to compare the mean of two given samples.
• Like a z-test, a t-test also assumes a normal distribution of the
sample.
• When we don’t know the population parameters (mean and standard
deviation), we use t-test.

CHI-SQUARE TEST
• We use the chi-square test to compare categorical variables.
• We use a t-test to compare the mean of two given samples, but we
use the chi-square test to compare categorical variables.

ANOVA
• We use analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare three or more
samples with a single test.
